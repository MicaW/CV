### UX Design | Web Development | Digital Strategy

Human-centred web designer/developer and agile advocate with a passion for creating stunning digital experiences.

I have experience from end-to-end of the software development process, giving me a unique ability to understand and address both user needs and business needs; backed with an understanding of the underlying technologies and software craftsmanship needed to meet them.


## SKILLS


#### USER FOCUSED

I take a human-centred approach to problem solving, building empathy for the people I’m designing for in order to create solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs. I’ve established my own toolbox of techniques to understand and tackle user needs collected from; being surrounded by the best in the business as a Senior UX Designer at IBM IX (E-Consultancy’s #1 digital agency 2016 www.digitalagencies.econsultancy.com), Design Thinking bootcamp, General Assembly’s UX Design course, meet-ups and obsessive reading. My role at IX involved the following:

  * Facilitating Design Thinking workshops
  * Customer journeys
  * User flows
  * Wireframes
  * Prototypes
  * User Research
  * User Testing


#### EXCELLENT COMMUNICATOR

I’m a people person and excel at communicating complex technical problems in a clear and easy to understand way, gained from experience bridging between technical teams and the customer:

  * Having worked as a UX Designer I have established storytelling skills to communicate the user requirements to the wider team. I also take pride my ability to make users feel at ease when conducting research and user testing.

  * Having worked as a Digital Strategy Consultant I'm comfortable presenting to audiences of varying sizes and seniority, gaining buy in from key stakeholders. I have also facilitated workshops (both F2F and via conference call) in order to establish business requirements, engaging the group and encouraging input from each attendee.

  * I have run graduate inductions for IBM, introducing new starters to the ways of working, and facilitating learning.

  * Having worked for 1.5 years as a copywriter at Quadmark, I’ve learnt how to write engaging content sent to over 10,000 people around the globe.

* Having worked as a Customer Service Representative I have experience managing customer complaints, and providing friendly customer service even in challenging situations.


#### AGILE

I’m an advocate of agile project management, due to the focus it places on continuous iterative improvement (both of the product and the team!)

  * I’m a certified Agile Scrum Master gained from the Scrum Alliance

  * I have been working on Agile teams for 1.5 years, taking part in ceremonies such as stand ups, retrospectives, sprint planning, estimation, sprint reviews etc. I even created an Agile Handbook to give to clients, introducing them to the way of working compared to traditional management styles, in addition to outlining the roles, ceremonies and requirements from them.

  * I have experience working in an iterative and agile way on a digital transformation programme for Castrol, in which we came up with 50 digital services that they could introduce to improve their digital offering. Using data collected from user research, we then created Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for the highest priority projects, and again took them to customers for testing and feedback. The ones which prompted the best response from customers were then chosen to be scaled, again improved upon and have now gone live.


#### QUICK LEARNER

Throughout my career I have sought to continuously learn and develop my skill set. I have regularly proven that I can enter a new place, and quickly pick up the ways of working and skills required for the role:

 * Having worked for IBM IX (IBM’s digital agency), Quadmark (IT Consultancy), and various temping agencies, I am used to taking on projects with new clients, in new industries and in varying roles. My ability to hit the ground running is something I have regularly been praised for in feedback, and has led to quick progression in any role I have ever taken on.

 * I have recently completed a Software Engineering bootcamp at Makers Academy, a notoriously intensive course which teaches principles of software craftsmanship and guides you to becoming a junior full-stack developer. For our final project, myself and my team built a fully functioning website using a technology stack we had never used before (Mongo-DB, Express, and Node) in under 8 days. In this time, we had to design the site, learn the technology, build it and test it. Check it out: www.developers-dictionary.com. 

 * I pivoted my career from Digital Strategy into UX design in 2015, taking a part time course at General Assembly, then moving into a UX role. Within a few months I was assigned as core UX designer for my team, and a few months after that promoted to Design Lead for an entire digital transformation programme.


#### ATTENTION TO DETAIL

I believe that the details are the difference between good stuff, and great stuff:

 * When coding I tirelessly assess my code line-by-line (sometimes even reading it backwards) to ensure that everything is as it should be, refactoring as I go to ensure I have the cleanest code possible.

 * When designing a website, I notice the smallest things that no-one else may notice. This is important when reviewing designs and ensuring the user flow is as intuitive as possible.

 * When I worked as a copywriter we had a process in which all of our work was reviewed by a colleague before sending out. This process of reviewing / being reviewed meant that over time I became hyper-aware of grammar / punctuation etc.

 * I have worked with high-profile clients on high-profile projects including HP, Google, RBS, Department of Work and Pensions, and a Global Satellite company(NDA). These projects require extreme care, particularly at RBS where I lead the testing of a huge migration of data to their side-arm Williams and Glynn. This project was highly visible, and my role involved ensuring we were on track and that all stakeholders were aware of the progress we were making. 


#### LEADERSHIP

I’m a natural leader, and adopt a transformative style of leadership; leading through building rapport and empathy for the team, coaching and developing the team, and inspiring towards a common goal. I’ve built this style over my career through the following:

 * My most recent role at IBM was as Design Lead for a digital transformation programme at Castrol for 10 digital products. This role required me to plan the project, and keep the design standards high across multiple designers and developers split between the UK, Bucharest and the US.

 * Through IBM I spent 6 months as an Operations Lead at RBS. I had the responsibility of managing the daily execution of testing according to plan. I led a global team with people in South Africa, India, London and Edinburgh. These teams were a split of IBM, RBS, Infosys and contract staff, and my role required the coordination of all of these - bringing people together to discuss issues, resolve and move forwards. These issues occurred regularly, and it was my job to help turn the problems into actionable solutions. This was a huge and incredibly complex global project with multiple phases of testing. Each phase comprised of around 20,000 – 30,000 test cases, running across 20 different platforms. 

 * I received a Gold Leadership award during my Leadership module at University, which involved coursework and exams on the theory of leadership, in addition to clocking over 400 volunteer hours for the charity Read International. My role was Resource Collections Lead, during which I led a team to collect and sort over 40,000 disused textbooks from 54 schools in the Greater Manchester region, and collaborated with other volunteers to raise over £7,500 to send these books to schools in East Africa who were in need of study resources. I then spent the summer in Tanzania working in partnership with the Ministry of Education to curriculum match, allocate, and distribute these books to 28 schools, and build and launch a library in the local area.


#### INNOVATIVE

I’m an ideas person, and thrive in an entrepreneurial and innovative environment:

 * As a Digital Strategist at IBM, I worked with large clients to define their digital roadmaps. This involved looking at their current customer journeys, and running ideation sessions on how they could be improved. I would then design and print a mural containing future vision that they could put on their wall to strive for in their future decision making.

 * I specialised in Innovation and Entrepreneurship at University, and enjoy reading start up literature just for fun. I attend conferences about the future of industries (E.g. a 3 day conference on the future of retail), and regularly attend meet ups to find out about start-ups and to learn about innovations in technology.
