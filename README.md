## MICA WHITBY

I'm a versatile and adaptive web designer, looking to for opportunities to use my human-centred and hands-on approach to problem-solving to create stunning digital experiences. 

I've gained experience from end-to-end of the software development process, having worked in digital strategy consulting, project management, UX design and web development â€“ giving me a unique ability to understand and address both user needs and business needs; backed with solid understanding of the underlying technologies needed to meet them.

## Skills

#### User focused

As a Senior UX designer at IBM Interactive Experience (IX), I always take a human-centred approach during product development. Empathy is key to developing an outstanding product, and I have established my own toolbox of techniques to understand and tackle user needs; collected from Design Thinking practices, a 10 week General Assembly UX Design course, obsessive reading, and being surrounded by the best in the business. 

#### Excellent Communicator

My career so far has shaped me into a great communicator; 
- Having worked as a UX Designer I have established storytelling skills. I also take pride my ability to make users feel at ease when conducting research and user testing.
- Having worked as a Strategy Consultant / Business Analyst I'm comfortable presenting to audiences of varying sizes and seniority, gaining buy in from key stakeholders. I have also facilitated workshops (both F2F and via conference call) in order to establish business requirements, engaging the group and encouraging input from each attendee.
- Having worked for 1.5 years as a copywriter I've learnt how to write engaging content.
- Having worked as a Customer Service Representative I have experience managing customer complaints, and providing friendly customer service even in challenging situations.
