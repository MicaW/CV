## MICA WHITBY

### UX Design | Web Development | Digital Strategy

Human-centred web designer/developer and agile advocate, with a passion for creating stunning digital experiences.

I have experience from end-to-end of the software development process, giving me a unique ability to understand and address both user needs and business needs; backed with an understanding of the underlying technologies and software craftsmanship needed to meet them.


## SKILLS

#### EXCELLENT COMMUNICATOR

I’m a people person and excel at communicating complex technical problems in a clear and easy to understand way, gained from experience bridging between technical teams and the customer. Examples include:

 * Storytelling when presenting, using visuals where possible. Show don’t tell. 
 * Putting users at ease during User Research and User Testing.
 * Comfortable presenting to audiences of varying sizes and seniority, and gaining buy in from key stakeholders.
 * Workshop facilitation.
 * Running graduate inductions and experienced hire assessment centres.
 * Writing engaging training and marketing content, sent to over 10,000 people around the globe.
 * Managing customer complaints and providing friendly customer service even in challenging situations.


#### AGILE

  * I’m a certified Agile Scrum Master gained from the Scrum Alliance.
  * I’ve worked on Agile teams for 1.5 years. I even created an Agile Handbook to give to clients on previous projects.
  * Worked iteratively on a digital transformation programme for Castrol, in which we came up with 50 services that they could introduce to improve their digital offering. We did user research, picked the most exciting ideas, and created MVPs; which we took to customers for testing and feedback. The ones which the customers were most excited about were then chosen to be scaled.


#### QUICK LEARNER

I've consistently proven that I can enter a new place, and quickly pick up the the role:

 * Having worked for various agencies, I'm used to taking on projects with new clients, in new industries and in varying roles. My ability to hit the ground running is something I've regularly been praised for in feedback.
 * I've recently completed a Software Engineering bootcamp at Makers Academy. For our final project, myself and my team built a fully functioning website using a technology stack we had never used before (Mongo-DB, Express, and Node) in under 8 days. In this time, we had to plan it, design it, learn the technology, build and test it. [See it here](www.developers-dictionary.com)
 * I pivoted my career into UX design in 2015, taking a part-time course at General Assembly, then moving into a UX role. Within a few months I was assigned as core UX designer for my team, and a few months after that promoted to Design Lead for an entire digital transformation programme.


#### ATTENTION TO DETAIL

Proven through:

 * Writing clean code.
 * Paying attention to the details that make an experience stand out when designing a website.
 * Reviewing content and having my content reviewed before publishing.
 * Working with high-profile clients including HP, Google, RBS, Department of Work and Pensions, and a Global Satellite company (NDA) on highly visible projects.


#### LEADERSHIP

I’ve built a transformative leadership style over my career through the following:

 * As Design Lead for a digital transformation programme at Castrol, I had to plan the project, and keep the design standards high across multiple designers and developers split between the UK, Bucharest and the US.
 * As Operational Plan Lead at RBS (through IBM) I had the responsibility of managing the daily execution of testing according to plan. I led a global team with people in South Africa, India, London and Edinburgh. These teams were a split of IBM, RBS, Infosys and contract staff, and my role required the coordination of all of these - bringing people together to discuss issues, resolve and move forwards.
 * I received a Gold Leadership award during my Leadership module at University, which involved coursework and exams on the theory of leadership, in addition to clocking over 400 volunteer hours for the charity Read International. My role was Resource Collections Lead, during which I led a team to collect and sort over 40,000 disused textbooks from 54 schools in the Greater Manchester region, and collaborated with other volunteers to raise over £7,500 to send these books to schools in East Africa. I then spent the summer in Tanzania working in partnership with the Ministry of Education to curriculum match, allocate, and distribute these books to 28 schools, and build and launch a library in the local area.


#### USER FOCUSED

I’ve established my own toolbox of techniques to understand and tackle user needs collected from; being surrounded by the best in the business as a Senior UX Designer at IBM IX ([E-Consultancy’s #1 digital agency 2016](www.digitalagencies.econsultancy.com)), attending a Design Thinking bootcamp, General Assembly’s UX Design course, meet-ups and obsessive reading. My role at IX involved the following:

  * Facilitating Design Thinking workshops
  * Customer journeys
  * User flows
  * Wireframes
  * Prototypes
  * User Research
  * User Testing


#### INNOVATIVE

I’m an ideas person, and thrive in a creative and entrepreneurial environment:

 * As a Digital Strategist at IBM, I worked with large clients to define their digital roadmaps. This involved looking at their current customer journeys, and running ideation sessions on how they could be improved. I would then design and print a mural containing future vision that they could put on their wall to strive for in their future decision making.
 * I specialised in Innovation and Entrepreneurship at University, and enjoy reading start up literature just for fun. I attend conferences about the future of industries (E.g. a 3 day conference on the future of retail), and regularly attend meet ups to find out about cutting edge start-ups and to learn about innovations in technology. 

## PROJECTS AT MAKERS

Project | Technologies used | Interesting fact
------------ | ------------- | -------------
[Developers Dictionary](https://github.com/MicaW/developers-dictionary) | Node, Express, MongoDB, JavaScript, jQuery, SVG, CSS, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Zombie & Heroku | I pitched this idea, and it was incredible to see the vision come to life in less than 8 days!
[Majordomo](https://github.com/MicaW/majordomo) | Ruby, Rails, Rspec, Capybara, CSS, JQuery, PostgreSQL | We had 5 days to make this room booking tool. This is when I fell in love with front-end development.
[CabinBnB](https://github.com/MicaW/makersbnb) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara & BCrypt | Again we had 5 days to create a clone of Airbnb, after only having been coding for 6 weeks! This is when I realised what is possible.
