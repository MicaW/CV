My career so far has shaped me into a great communicator; 
- Having worked as a UX Designer I have established storytelling skills. I also take pride my ability to make users feel at ease when conducting research and user testing.
- Having worked as a Strategy Consultant / Business Analyst I'm comfortable presenting to audiences of varying sizes and seniority, gaining buy in from key stakeholders. I have also facilitated workshops (both F2F and via conference call) in order to establish business requirements, engaging the group and encouraging input from each attendee.
- Having worked for 1.5 years as a copywriter I've learnt how to write engaging content.
